Mr. President:
Regarding your instructions to “get me some more cubans,” were you referring to
cigars or people? If it is the former, I will have a box delivered to your office
this afternoon. If it is the latter, I would respectfully suggest that we do not
want another Elian incident (although my strike team in Miami can be deployed in a
matter of minutes). I will await your further instructions.
Regards,
Janet
