put the turkey into the oven
now the turkey is in the oven
then take the turkey from the oven and put it onto the stove
now the turkey is ready to serve
yum yum yum put the turkey into your mouth
a fine kettle of finnish fish from the market
the pie
into the woods
grandmother lives on a farm over the river
the finnish chef hopes you have a happy thanksgiving
